This repository contains my final dissertation for the Master's programme in Data Science at the University of Trento. The dissertation is based on the internship project that I undertook at a private company, therefore the code that I realized cannot be publicly disclosed. Should you have any questions about this work, feel free to get in touch with me.

The thesis focus on corporate sustainability performance and, more specifically, on the construction of a sustainability scoring system that evaluates business contributions to the <b>17 UN Sustainable Development Goals</b>, by combining traditional and <b>alternative data</b>.
